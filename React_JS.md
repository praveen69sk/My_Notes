## <u>Hooks in Reacts JS: </u>
1. useState()
2. useEffect()
    * --> For fixing side efects, lifecycle management
3. useRef()
    * --> With this we can control/modify the any of the dom elements. but it's not recomended way 
4. forwardRef()
   * --> Forwarding the ref from parent to child
5. useFormStatus()
    * --> Works only with forms
6. useTransition()
7. useActionState()
8. useId()
9. useReducer()
    * --> When we have a big form with multiple fields, Then it's beter to go with useReducer() hook instead of useState() hook.
